    <p>The Eclipse Foundation has been a partner in many publicly funded research projects since 2013. We help organizations to successfully create, publish, and sustain an open source software platform, making the results of the research projects available for commercial or public exploitation. </p>
    <p>The Eclipse Foundation welcomes the opportunity to work with new industry research projects. If you would like more information please contact us at research@eclipse.org</p>
