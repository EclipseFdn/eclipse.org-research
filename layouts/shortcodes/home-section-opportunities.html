        <h3>More exploitation opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          Exploitation is driven by availability, open governance, quality, and IP cleanliness. Providing the platform under an OSS license such as the <a
            href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-2.0/EPL-2.0.html">Eclipse Public License</a> supports these goals very well. Users and adopters can trust the open governance model that
          provides a level playing field and commercial exploitation under this business-friendly open source license. The Eclipse IP process ensures that the IP created is tracked and properly managed.

        <h3>Extensibility, sustainability and maturity</h3>
        <p>In some industries, platforms and tools must be available for a lifecycle of well over 20 years. With the experience of the Eclipse Foundation and the Eclipse ecosystem, it is possible to
          provide long-term support and design the platform in a way that allows for continuous and open innovation.
        </p>
        <p>Industrial applications require measurable indicators of project maturity. The Eclipse Foundation deploys assessment processes and tools in Polarsys to help members evaluate the maturity of
          Eclipse projects and to support projects in achieving higher maturity levels.
