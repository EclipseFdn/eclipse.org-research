        </h3>
        <p>Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity, OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
        </p>
        <p>
          The open and secure Eclipse Kuksa project will contain a cloud platform that interconnects a wide range of vehicles to the cloud via in-car and internet connections. This platform will be supported by an integrated open source software development environment including technologies to cope especially with software challenges for vehicles designed in the IoT, Cloud, and digital era.

          The goal of the BaSys project is to provide virtual middleware for industrial automation which implements Industry 4.0 concepts leading to efficient changeability and adaptability in production processes. The platform will accomplish this by enabling the networking and integration of existing technologies such as OPC-UA and oneM2M.

        <p>
          Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software. Eclipse CROSSMETER will support the eﬃcient and eﬀective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions on the architecture level (to decide to select and OSS project) and on the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, CROSSMETER will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development eﬀort and increase the quality of the ﬁnal software products.

        <p>One of the outstanding results of OPEES is the creation of PolarSys, the Eclipse Working Group for open source tools for embedded systems.</p>
        <p>
          The growing PolarSys community of members includes Airbus, CEA LIST, Ericsson, Thales, and several SMEs. Projects provide open source solutions for systems engineering, from requirements engineering to verification and validation, including development and debug.
