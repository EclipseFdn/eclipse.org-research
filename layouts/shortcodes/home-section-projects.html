        </h3>
        <p>The Arrowhead Tools project aims for digitalisation and automation solutions for the European industry, which will close the gaps that hinder the IT/OT integration by introducing new technologies in an open source platform for the design and run-time engineering of IoT and System of Systems. The project will provide engineering processes, integration platform, tools and tool chains for the cost-efficient development of digitalisation, connectivity and automation system solutions in various fields of application.</p>

        <p>BaSys 4.2 with its open-source reference implementation Eclipse BaSyx digitalizes manufacturing processes and integrates the devices on the shopfloor with a company's IT.</p>
        <p>BaSys 4.2 bridges different protocols and thus enables communication between devices and IT. In order for this communcation to work, however, a common language is necessary that gives meaning to the information.</p>

        <p>
          BRAIN-IoT looks at heterogeneous IoT scenarios where instances of IoT architectures can be built dynamically combining and federating a distributed set of IoT services, IoT platforms and other enabling functionalities made available in marketplaces and accessible by means of open and standard IoT APIs and protocols.

        </h3>
        <p>The goal of Panorama is to research into model-based methods and tools to master design and development of heterogeneous systems by heterogeneous parties, and provide best practice and guidance for development. To that end, the main line of action is extending the scope of current system level approaches by enhancing existing abstract performance meta-models to be suitable for heterogeneous hardware, and heterogeneous function domains. We will stand on the shoulder of giants by building on the meta-model developed in the AMALTHEA and AMALTHEA4 public projects, taking results from projects such as TIMMO, Timmo2USE, ARAMiS I & II into account. Thereby, the enhanced meta-model must be a common and open standard to support development by diverse parties across organizations.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.pdp4e-project.eu/">PDP4E</a></h3>
        <p>PDP4E is an innovation action that will provide software and system engineers with methods and software tools to systematically apply data protection principles in the projects they carry out, so that the products they create comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thus bringing the principles of Privacy and Data Protection by Design to practice.</p>
        <p>PDP4E will integrate privacy and data protection engineering functionalities into existent, mainstream software tools that are already in use by engineers, focusing on open-source tools that will be integrated in the Eclipse ecosystem, The approach will integrate methods proposed by the privacy engineering community (e.g. LINDDUN, ISO/IEC 27550 Privacy engineering), and the industry of software and system engineering tools (e.g. MUSE, PAPYRUS or OpenCert) using a model driven engineering approach. PDP4E will introduce privacy and data protection into software and system engineering disciplines (Risk Management, Requirements Engineering, Model-Driven Design, and Assurance), which drive the everyday activities of engineers.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>RobMoSys aims to coordinate the whole communityâ€™s best and consolidated efforts to realise a step-change towards a European ecosystem for open and sustainable industry-grade software development for robotics. The project develops model-driven methods and tools building on top of current code-centric robotics platforms, enabling interoperability between different robotics domains in an efficient and systematic way. A core part of the project is active community building and management to maximize synergies among robotics practitioners.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>The main objective of SmartCLIDE is to propose a radically new smart cloud-native development environment, based on the
coding-by-demonstration principle, that will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, testing
and deployment of full-stack data-centred services and applications in the cloud. SmartCLIDE will provide high levels of
abstraction at all stages (development, testing, deployment and run-time) as well as self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS
Services.</p>
