summary: "An integrated approach built on top of the current code-centric robotic platforms."
---
RobMoSys envisions an integrated approach built on top of the current code-centric robotic platforms, by applying model-driven methods and tools.
RobMoSys will enable the management of the interfaces between different robotics-related domains in an efficient and systematic way according to each systemâ€™s needs.

* RobMoSys aims to establish Quality-of-Service properties, enabling a composition-oriented approach while preserving modularity.
* RobMoSys will drive the non-competitive part of building a professional quality ecosystem by encouraging the community involvement.
* RobMoSys will elaborate many of the common robot functionalities based on broad involvement of the community via two Open Calls.
