summary: "Model-based methods and tools to master design and development of heterogeneous systems."
---
The goal of Panorama is to research into model-based methods and tools to master design and development of heterogeneous systems by heterogeneous parties, and provide best practice and guidance for development. To that end, the main line of action is extending the scope of current system level approaches by enhancing existing abstract performance meta-models to be suitable for heterogeneous hardware, and heterogeneous function domains. We will stand on the shoulder of giants by building on the meta-model developed in the AMALTHEA and AMALTHEA4 public projects, taking results from projects such as TIMMO, Timmo2USE, ARAMiS I & II into account. Thereby, the enhanced meta-model must be a common and open standard to support development by diverse parties across organizations.
