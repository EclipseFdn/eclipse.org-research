summary: "The smart cloud-native development environment, based on the coding-by-demonstration principle."
---
The main objective of SmartCLIDE is to propose a radically new smart cloud-native development environment, based on the coding-by-demonstration principle, that will support creators of cloud services in the discovery, creation, composition, testing and deployment of full-stack data-centred services and applications in the cloud. SmartCLIDE will provide high levels of abstraction at all stages (development, testing, deployment and run-time) as well as self-discovery of IaaS and SaaS Services.
