One of the outstanding results of OPEES is the creation of PolarSys, the Eclipse Working Group for open source tools for embedded systems.

The growing PolarSys community of members includes Airbus, CEA LIST, Ericsson, Thales, and several SMEs. Projects provide open source solutions for systems engineering, from requirements engineering to verification and validation, including development and debug.
